        "# Colab Inference for MedleyVox\n",
        "\n",
        "Medley Vox is a [dataset for testing algorithms for separating multiple singers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07302) within a single music track. Also, the [authors of Medley Vox](https://github.com/jeonchangbin49/MedleyVox) proposed a neural network architecture for separating singers. However, unfortunately, they did not publish the weights. Later, their training process was [repeated by Cyru5](https://huggingface.co/Cyru5/MedleyVox/tree/main), who trained several models and published the weights in the public domain. Now this WebUI is created to use the trained models and weights for inference. Here are some precautions:\n",
        "1. Put the [downloaded models](https://huggingface.co/Cyru5/MedleyVox) in the 'checkpoints' folder in folder format, with each model folder containing a model file (.pth) and its corresponding configuration file (.json).\n",
        "2. If you use overlapadd and the choice of model is 'w2v' or 'w2v_chunk', you need to download the pretrained model [xlsr_53_56k.pt](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fairseq/wav2vec/xlsr_53_56k.pt) and put it in the 'pretrained' folder.\n",
        "3. At present, the audio output sampling rate supported by the model is 24000kHz and cannot be changed. To solve this, you can use [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Apollo](https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo), or [Music Source Separation Training](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Music-Source-Separation-Training) for audio super-resolution.\n",
        "4. When using WebUI on cloud platforms or Colab, please place the audio to be processed in the 'inputs' folder, and the processing results will be stored in the 'results' folder. The 'Select folder' and 'Open folder' buttons are invalid in the cloud.\n",
        "5. If the input is too long, it may be impossible to inference due to lack of VRAM. In that case, use 'use_overlapadd'. Among the 'use_overlapadd' options, \"ola\", \"ola_norm\", and \"w2v\" all work well. Use w2v_chunk or sf_chunk if these fail or as desired. You can also try experimenting with 'vad_method' options spec and webrtc when using either of the \"_chunk\" methods. Chunking has proven to be very useful therefore it is on by default."
